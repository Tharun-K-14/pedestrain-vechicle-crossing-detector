**Pedestrian Vehicle Crossing Detector Using Arduino**

This project demonstrates the creation of a Pedestrian Vehicle Crossing Detector system using an Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and basic traffic logic to detect the crossing of vehicles and pedestrians at a designated crossing point. The system helps in managing the traffic flow and ensures safety for pedestrians.

**Project Overview**

The Pedestrian Vehicle Crossing Detector is designed to automate the detection of both vehicles and pedestrians approaching a designated crossing area. The system can be implemented for smart traffic management, where it detects the presence of vehicles and pedestrians using sensors and then triggers a signal or action, such as turning on a traffic light or activating a crossing signal.

**Components Used:**

Arduino Uno board
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
IR Sensors (optional for pedestrian detection)
LED (for signal indication)
Buzzer (optional for alerting the user)
Servo motor (optional for controlling a gate or sign)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Power supply
Features:
Vehicle Detection: Using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure the distance between the sensor and an object (vehicle). When a vehicle crosses the detection zone, it triggers an event, such as illuminating a red LED to signal stop or activating a gate.

Pedestrian Detection: Additional IR sensors (or simple push buttons) can be placed at pedestrian entry points to trigger pedestrian crossing signals or make the system aware of human movement.

Signal Control: The system can be extended to control traffic signals using LEDs, or even trigger servos or motors to raise or lower gates for vehicles to pass.

Auditory Alerts: A buzzer or sound system can be added to alert the pedestrians or drivers about an incoming signal or the need to stop.

**How It Works:**

Vehicle Detection:

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor sends a pulse to detect the presence of an object (vehicle) within a specified range.
When the vehicle enters the detection zone, the sensor measures the distance and sends the data to the Arduino board.
Based on the distance measurement, the Arduino can trigger the system to show red lights, activate a gate, or provide other traffic control signals.
Pedestrian Detection:

IR sensors are used to detect if a pedestrian is waiting or crossing. These sensors detect motion or presence within the sensor range.
When a pedestrian is detected, the system will activate the corresponding signals for pedestrian safety (such as green pedestrian light).
Traffic Signal/Action:

Based on the detected input, the Arduino controls the state of the traffic light system (Red/Yellow/Green), a pedestrian crossing signal, or other mechanisms like gates.
Circuit Design:
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:

The sensor sends out an ultrasonic pulse and measures the time taken for the pulse to reflect back from an object (vehicle).
This distance measurement is sent to the Arduino to determine whether a vehicle has crossed the threshold.
IR Sensors (optional):

Used for detecting pedestrian presence at the crossing point.
The sensor detects when the beam is interrupted by a person crossing or standing in the detection zone.
LEDs and Buzzer:

LEDs are used to simulate traffic signals (Green, Yellow, Red) and pedestrian signals (Walk/Stop).
The buzzer emits an alert when the vehicle or pedestrian is detected or the traffic system changes states.
Servo Motor (optional):

If needed, a servo motor can be controlled to simulate a gate or crossing barrier that opens or closes when a vehicle is detected.
